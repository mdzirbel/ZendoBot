A Rule is the way that the Discord bot can know whether someone else's guess is correct.
Rules work a bit like math. (a + b) * c is a valid math statement. Similarly, rules use parentheses and operations to reach an end result
Rules can use Sets, Numbers, and Boolean (True/False) conditions

Let's look at a basic rule: `word is subset of dictionary`
There are three elements to this rule: "word", "is subset of", and "dictionary".
`word` is the list of words that are in the guess. If someone guessed "Hello My Name Is Matthew", `word` would be the set: ["Hello", "My", "Name", "Is", "Matthew"]
`dictionary` is the entire list of words, ["a", "aa", "aaa", "aachen", "aardvark" ...]
`<Set1> is subset of <Set2>` is a rule. It returns True if everything in <Set1> is also in <Set2>.
In this case, "Matthew" is not in the dictionary, so our guess does not fit the rule

A more formal look at rule creation:
The formal definition of all the rules is in the definitions channel
The contents of 
Every rule takes some type of value, and returns some type of value
The return value in the outermost rule will usually be a boolean. If it's not: Numbers other than 0 -> True, 0 -> False, and Sets which are not empty -> True, empty sets -> False
To check whether a rule can go somewhere, check whether its output type matches the input type
Make sure to put parentheses around all rules except your outermost one, and put spaces precisely as described

What if we want to make a more complicated rule?
Let's make a rule "Every second word must contain a vowel".
First, we get every second word in the guess, by using a Set operation `every 2nd word`
We need to check for each word, so we'll use `(<Set> s#, <Location> l#)[Condition]`. This is a powerful operation which goes through the <Set>, using s# as
each element in turn, with l# relative to s#. It then gives us the number of times the condition was met.
s# and l# are how we decide to refer to the nth element and relative location, eg. (<Set> s1, <Location> l1)[some condition with s1 and l1]
To set up the part inside parentheses:
    We will put `(every 2nd word)` as the <Set>.
    We can decide to reference the element as s1
    We're not using the relative location, so we can just skip it
So now we have `((every 2nd word) s1)[Some Condition]`
the condition is that the word has a vowel, which will look like `s1 contains vowel`
Putting it together: `((every 2nd word) s1)[s1 contains vowel]`. We now need a boolean value, by checking if the number of matches equals the number of words we're checking.
Adding this together: `((every 2nd word) s1)[s1 contains vowel] == (length of (every 2nd word))`



Some additional notes on rules, for those who know coding, especially Python:
Sets are represented by lists
